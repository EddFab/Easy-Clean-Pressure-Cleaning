My brother's website for his pressure cleaning business

Technologies used in this project:

I built this site using a template (link included). I removed much of the extra that I didn't need. I added a contact form, ajax picture-loading. I changed the theme and made a few other tweaks to get it to where it's at now.

1. Adobe Photoshop

2. HTML5

3. CSS3

4. JavaScript

5. jQuery

6. AJAX / PHP

7. Twitter Bootstrap
